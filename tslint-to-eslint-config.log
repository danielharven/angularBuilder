7 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * arrow-body-style:
    - ESLint will throw an error if the function body is multiline yet has a one-line return on it.
  * brace-style:
    - ESLint's brace-style will check all tokens.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * no-console:
    - Custom console methods, if they exist, will no longer be allowed.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading or trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be forbidden.
  * padded-blocks:
    - ESLint's padded-blocks rule also bans a blank line before a closing brace.

Error: multiple output react/jsx-curly-spacing ESLint rule options were generated, but tslint-to-eslint-config doesn't have "merger" logic to deal with this.
Please file an issue at https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config/issues/new?template=missing_merger.md. Thanks!

3 rules are not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have ESLint equivalents:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "import-spacing".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "use-life-cycle-interface".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "whitespace".

  * import-destructuring-spacing
